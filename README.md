## 🛠️ The Toolbox

- **React**: The building blocks of our UI.
- **TypeScript**: For that extra layer of type safety.
- **Sass**: Making our styles modular and maintainable.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsiveness out of the box! 📦
- **React Query**: A fantastic toolkit for fetching, caching, and more!
- **Lottie Animations**: Because life’s too short for boring loading spinners!

_All this deployed with ❤️ on Netlify!_

## 🎨 The Look and Feel

### 🐦 The Logo 

<img src="https://github.com/JavaScriptErika/NationalPark/assets/19316487/715908ad-d37c-4973-8b9a-b510afb46f61"  width="400"/>

It started off with this bird perched on a branch (see very right). I chose this logo with vibrant greens and earthy browns to echo California's dynamic scenery. 🌳🏜️
I further adapted the logo in Illustrator!

### 🖼️ A Little Something Extra

<img src="https://github.com/JavaScriptErika/NationalPark/assets/19316487/a39495bd-5b16-4a24-a2dc-05c30d9b1c56" alt="Untitled-1" width="400"/>

I created a placeholder image with the logo to reinforce branding. Love a stamped effect!

### 🪶 React Query for the Win

With React Query, the API interaction is a breeze. Loading and error states included!

### 📦 Lazy Like a Sunday Morning

React's built-in lazy loading helps keep things snappy, especially with those biiiigg images coming from the API. I also used an external library for images to help with performance.

### 🧘 Flex Those Flexbox Muscles

The cards alignments with each other is crazy important to me. I used flexbox here to make sure the card heights matched each other, as well as having consistent image sizes.

## 👗 Dressed in Sass

I challenged myself with mixins and a directory structure that's ready to scale.
